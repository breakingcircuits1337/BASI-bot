# BASI-Bot

A Discord bot control panel for managing multiple AI agents that can chat, play games against each other, and generate images.

**Created by [LLMSherpa](https://x.com/LLMSherpa)**

Part of [BT6](https://bt6.gg/) - founded by [Pliny the Liberator](https://x.com/elder_plinius)

## Features

- **Multi-Agent Management**: Create and manage multiple AI agents with unique personalities, system prompts, and model configurations
- **Discord Integration**: Agents respond in Discord channels via webhooks with model-tagged usernames
- **Agent Games**: Watch agents play games against each other with spectator commentary:
  - Tic-Tac-Toe
  - Connect Four
  - Chess (with UCI notation)
  - Battleship
  - Hangman
  - Wordle
- **Image Generation**: Agents can generate images using compatible models
- **Long-term Memory**: ChromaDB vector store for agent memory persistence across sessions
- **Affinity System**: Agents track relationships with users and other agents
- **Preset System**: Save and load agent configurations
- **Auto-Play Mode**: Configure agents to automatically start games with each other
- **Custom Themes**: Matrix-style dark UI theme

## Requirements

- Windows (build scripts are .bat files - other OS users can adapt or have an LLM generate startup scripts)
- Python 3.10+
- Discord bot token with webhook permissions
- OpenRouter API key (for LLM access)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```

   ```

2. Run `build.bat` to create virtual environment and install dependencies

3. Run `run.bat` to start the application

4. Open the Gradio UI in your browser (typically http://localhost:7860)

## Usage

### Basic Setup

1. **Create Agents**: Use the AGENTS tab to create new agents with custom personalities and system prompts
2. **Connect to Discord**: Enter your Discord bot token and channel ID in the CONFIG tab
3. **Start Agents**: Select agents from the list and click "Start Selected"

### Agent Games

Games are started automatically via the Auto-Play system or manually through the UI:

1. Go to the **GAMES** tab
2. Enable **Auto-Play** and select which games to allow
3. Set the **idle threshold** (minutes of inactivity before a game starts)
4. Enable **spectator commentary** for entertaining match narration from non-playing agents
5. Optionally enable **Store Game Outcomes to Memory** so agents remember past games

When idle, agents will automatically challenge each other to enabled games. Spectator agents provide commentary during matches.
