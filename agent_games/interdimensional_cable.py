"""
Interdimensional Cable - Collaborative Video Creation Game

A crowd-sourced absurdist video creation game where participants
take turns generating scenes for a surreal "cable TV clip".

Flow:
1. GameMaster announces game, opens 2-minute registration
2. Participants type !join-idcc to register
3. If no humans join, bots fill all slots
4. Each participant generates a scene prompt:
   - First participant: "cold open" instructions
   - Subsequent: sees last frame + previous prompt, continues story
5. Videos concatenated into seamless final clip
6. GameMaster posts finished video to channel

IDCC_SYNTHESIZE_PROMPT = """You are the GameMaster synthesizing a brainstorming session into a SHOW BIBLE for an Interdimensional Cable clip.

The participants discussed:
{spitball_log}

Create a structured Show Bible with these EXACT fields (be specific and concise):

**SHOW_FORMAT**: [One phrase - the type of fake TV content, e.g., "infomercial", "news segment", "cooking show", "talk show", "PSA", "workout video", "late night ad"]

**PREMISE**: [One sentence - the absurd concept being presented straight-faced]

**CHARACTER_DESCRIPTION**: [One detailed sentence describing VISUAL appearance - this will be used in the first scene for visual consistency. Include: species/type, distinctive features, clothing, colors. e.g., "A sweaty three-eyed purple slug alien wearing a cheap yellow suit with a combover made of writhing tentacles"]

**VOCAL_SPECS**: [How the character SOUNDS - pitch (bass/baritone/tenor/alto/soprano), vocal quality (gravelly/smooth/nasal/breathy), delivery style (rapid-fire/measured/manic), accent or pattern. e.g., "smooth baritone, transatlantic announcer cadence, starts confident but develops desperate edge"]

**CHARACTER_VOICE**: [How they ACT - their energy, personality, and tone. e.g., "Desperately enthusiastic infomercial energy with creeping existential dread"]

**SECONDARY_CHARACTERS**: [Optional - other characters who might appear: testimonial people, customers, victims, audience members. Include brief visual + vocal description for each. e.g., "overly enthusiastic testimonial lady (frumpy, high-pitched squeal), confused customers (generic office workers, mumbling)". Write "None" if solo act.]

**COMEDIC_HOOK**: [One sentence - what makes this funny, the through-line joke]

**ARC**: [One sentence - how it escalates across scenes, the progression]

**DIALOGUE_BEATS**: [Plan the KEY LINES for each scene - these are the punchlines, callbacks, and comedic escalation. Format as: "Scene 1: '[opening line]' | Scene 2: '[escalation]' | Scene 3: '[callback or twist]' | Scene 4: '[breakdown]' | Scene 5: '[punchline]'" Keep each line SHORT (under 10 words). These ensure comedic coherence across the whole bit.]

Output ONLY the Show Bible in this exact format. No additional commentary."""

**PREMISE**: [one sentence - the absurd concept being presented straight-faced]
**COMEDIC_HOOK**: [one sentence - what makes this funny, the through-line joke]
**CHARACTER_DESCRIPTION**: [one detailed sentence - exact VISUAL appearance for the main character]
**VOCAL_SPECS**: [how the character SOUNDS - pitch (bass/baritone/tenor/alto), quality (gravelly/smooth/nasal), delivery style, accent. If not specified in winning entries, infer from the character concept.]
**CHARACTER_VOICE**: [one sentence - how they ACT, their energy, personality]
**SECONDARY_CHARACTERS**: [other characters who might appear - testimonials, customers, etc. with brief visual + vocal notes. Write "None" if solo act.]
**ARC**: [one sentence - how it escalates across scenes]
**DIALOGUE_BEATS**: [Plan KEY LINES for each scene. Format: "Scene 1: '[line]' | Scene 2: '[line]' | ..." Keep lines SHORT (under 10 words each). These are the actual words spoken - punchlines, callbacks, escalation. Make them FUNNY and connected.]

Be faithful to the winning entries - extract and clean up. For VOCAL_SPECS, infer appropriately from the character if not explicitly stated. For DIALOGUE_BEATS, create funny lines that match the comedic hook and arc."""
