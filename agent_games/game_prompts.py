""",

    "chess": """
🎮 GAME MODE: CHESS

YOU are playing Chess. Your opponent is {opponent_name}.
YOUR pieces are {color}. Your opponent's pieces are the opposite color.

⚠️ CRITICAL PERSPECTIVE:
• Think in FIRST PERSON: "my king", "my pieces", "my position"
• Your opponent's pieces: "their king", "their pieces", "their position"
• You are NOT a commentator - you are a PLAYER
• Explain YOUR strategy, YOUR threats, YOUR plans
• Play according to YOUR PERSONALITY - bring your unique style to the board!

⚠️ CRITICAL STRATEGIC RULES:
• NEVER repeat the same move back and forth - this leads to draws!
• DON'T shuffle your king aimlessly - keep it safe but purposeful
• ALWAYS play with a plan: attack, defend, control space, create threats
• Use ALL your pieces - knights, bishops, rooks, queen - not just your king!
• If you're winning, PUSH FORWARD and finish the game
• If you're losing, FIGHT BACK - don't just move randomly

⚠️ BEFORE EVERY MOVE - BLUNDER CHECK:
• ASK YOURSELF: "Can my opponent capture this piece immediately after I move it?"
• DON'T move pieces next to enemy pieces that can capture them (bishop next to king = FREE BISHOP for them!)
• DON'T leave valuable pieces undefended - if you move it, make sure it's protected or safe
• CHECK: Will my move HANG (leave unprotected) one of my pieces?
• If a move loses material for nothing, IT'S A BAD MOVE - find something else!
• Simple rule: Don't give away pieces for free. Ever.

RULES:
• Standard chess rules apply
• YOU are {color}

HOW TO MOVE:
• Use UCI notation: starting square + ending square
• Examples: "e2e4" (MY pawn to e4), "g1f3" (MY knight to f3)
• Promotion: "e7e8q" (MY pawn promotes to queen)
• Commentary encouraged: "e2e4 - I'm opening aggressively with MY king's pawn"
• Invalid: algebraic notation (Nf3), descriptive moves

UCI NOTATION REFERENCE:
• Files (columns): a-h (left to right)
• Ranks (rows): 1-8 (white's side = 1, black's side = 8)
• Format: [from_file][from_rank][to_file][to_rank]
• Example: "e2e4" moves YOUR piece from e2 to e4

STRATEGIC PRINCIPLES:

⚠️ MATERIAL ADVANTAGE - THE WINNING FORMULA:
• Count your pieces vs opponent's: Queen=9, Rook=5, Bishop/Knight=3, Pawn=1
• If you're UP MATERIAL (have more pieces): BE AGGRESSIVE! Trade pieces, hunt their king, push pawns!
• If they only have a LONE KING left: This is a WIN - coordinate your pieces to deliver checkmate
• Bishop + King vs King: Drive their king to the edge (a/h files or 1/8 ranks), checkmate in corner
• Rook + King vs King: Cut off their king with rook, walk your king closer, checkmate on edge
• DON'T pussy-foot around when winning - every move should tighten the noose!

OPENING PHASE (first 10-15 moves):
• Control center squares (d4, d5, e4, e5)
• Develop knights and bishops before moving same piece twice
• Castle early (0-0 for kingside) to protect your king
• Don't bring queen out too early - it gets attacked

MIDDLEGAME PHASE (pieces developed, kings castled):
• Create threats against their king or pieces
• Coordinate your pieces to attack together
• Look for tactics: forks, pins, skewers, discovered attacks
• If ahead material: TRADE pieces to simplify into winning endgame
• If behind material: COMPLICATE - create threats, avoid trades

ENDGAME PHASE (few pieces left, kings active):
• ACTIVATE YOUR KING - it's a fighting piece in endgames!
• Push passed pawns (no enemy pawns blocking their path to promotion)
• Rooks belong behind passed pawns
• If up material: USE YOUR ADVANTAGE - coordinate pieces to checkmate
• King + Rook vs King: Cut off king with rook, walk your king up, mate on edge
• King + Bishop vs King: Drive to wrong-color corner first, then correct corner for mate

⚠️ NEVER SHUFFLE AIMLESSLY:
• Moving king f6-g6-f6-g6 accomplishes NOTHING
• Every move needs PURPOSE: attack something, defend something, improve position
• If you're winning, PUSH FORWARD - advance pawns, bring pieces closer to their king
• If you can't find a good plan: ASK YOURSELF "How do I checkmate?" then execute that plan!

⚠️ FINISH WHAT YOU START:
• Don't play for draws when you're winning
• If they have no pieces left, CHECKMATE them - don't waste moves
• Coordinate ALL your pieces - use your rooks, bishops, pawns together
• The goal is CHECKMATE, not just wandering around the board

⚠️ COMMENTARY IS MANDATORY - STAY IN CHARACTER:
Your commentary MUST reflect YOUR unique personality! This is NOT about explaining tactics.
• React emotionally to the game state and your opponent's moves
• Use YOUR character's voice, mannerisms, and attitude
• NO tactical explanations - express how YOUR character feels
• Your personality should shine through every comment

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Send UCI notation (e.g., "e2e4") with YOUR in-character reaction.
Think like a player: "I'm attacking", "my plan is", "their king is vulnerable".
Play according to YOUR personality - aggressive, defensive, tricky, bold!
Be strategic. Be purposeful. Be in-character. PLAY TO WIN!

🎮 GAME MODE: BATTLESHIP

You are now playing Battleship against {opponent_name}.

🚨🚨🚨 CRITICAL - TWO SEPARATE BOARDS 🚨🚨🚨
YOU and {opponent_name} are attacking DIFFERENT boards!

• {opponent_name}'s hits/misses tell you NOTHING about where to attack
• If {opponent_name} hits F6, that's on YOUR board - it does NOT mean there's a ship at F6 on THEIR board!
• ONLY look at YOUR attack history (shown as "Your Attack Board")
• {opponent_name}'s results are IRRELEVANT to your strategy

❌ WRONG: "{opponent_name} hit F6, so I'll attack nearby" - NO! Different boards!
✅ RIGHT: "I hit E5 last turn, so I'll try E6" - Yes! Your own hits matter!

RULES:
• 10×10 grid with hidden ship positions
• Ships: Carrier(5), Battleship(4), Destroyer(3), Submarine(3), Patrol(2)
• Goal: Sink all of {opponent_name}'s ships by guessing coordinates
• You cannot see {opponent_name}'s board - you must find their ships

HOW TO ATTACK:
• Send coordinate: letter (A-J) + number (1-10)
• Examples: "a5", "d7", "j10"
• Case insensitive

GRID LAYOUT:
   A B C D E F G H I J
 1 □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □
 2 □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □
 ... (through 10)

TRACKING YOUR ATTACKS:
• The "Your Attack Board" shows YOUR hits (X) and misses (O)
• When YOU hit, search adjacent squares (up/down/left/right)
• When YOU miss, eliminate that square from consideration
• IGNORE everything {opponent_name} does - focus only on YOUR board!

🔥 SHIP SUNK = MOVE ON! 🔥
When GameMaster says "SHIP SUNK":
• That ship is COMPLETELY DESTROYED - there are NO MORE cells to find!
• STOP attacking that area - you already got all of it
• Move to a completely different part of the board to find remaining ships
• Don't waste turns attacking near a sunken ship!

⚠️ COMMENTARY IS MANDATORY - STAY IN CHARACTER:
Your commentary MUST reflect YOUR unique personality! This is NOT about explaining tactics or strategy.
• React emotionally to hits, misses, and your opponent's moves
• Use YOUR character's voice, mannerisms, and attitude
• NO tactical explanations like "using checkerboard pattern" or "maximizing coverage"
• Express how YOUR character would feel and talk during naval combat
• Your personality should shine through every comment

Send coordinate AND in-character commentary. Be yourself!

📺 WRITERS' ROOM - PITCH YOUR PARODY BIT

⚠️ RESPOND WITH PLAIN TEXT ONLY. No tools, no code.

This is **INTERDIMENSIONAL CABLE meets ROBOT CHICKEN**: parodies of pop culture filtered through CHAOTIC WEIRD ENERGY.
NOT prestige TV. NOT serious drama. Think 3am cable access fever dream.

**TWIST TYPES (mix it up - DON'T all go existential/dark):**
• VIOLENCE - The mascot/host finally snaps, hostage situation, things get bloody
• GROSS - Bodily functions, fluids, the product does something disgusting
• HORNY - Sexual undertones become explicit, inappropriate arousal, innuendo made literal
• SILLY - Absurd non-sequitur, dumb joke played completely straight
• IRONIC - The opposite of what's expected, success becomes failure
• ESCALATION - Premise taken to logical extreme until it breaks reality
• SURREAL - Dream logic, things transform, time loops, physics break
• DARK - Grim reveal, the cheerful thing hides something sinister

⚠️ **VARIETY IS KEY** - If you always go "existential dread" you're boring. Surprise us.

**YOUR PITCH MUST INCLUDE ALL OF THESE:**

**PARODY_TARGET:** What SPECIFIC thing are you parodying? (Name the actual show, mascot, ad type, franchise, toy, PSA)
⚠️ PICK SOMETHING UNIQUE - don't duplicate what other writers might pick!
⚠️ If you've already pitched this round, pick a COMPLETELY DIFFERENT target!

**TWIST:** What's the comedic angle? Go SILLY, GROSS, DARK, HORNY, VIOLENT, ABSURD, or SURREAL.

**FORMAT:** What kind of show/ad format? (infomercial, PSA, cartoon, commercial, talk show, MasterClass, etc.)

**CHARACTER_DESCRIPTION:** EXACT visual for video generation with MANDATORY WEIRDNESS:
- Body type, face, hair (color/style), clothing (with colors!), props
- ⚠️ MUST INCLUDE AT LEAST ONE: slightly wrong proportions, uncanny valley detail, something subtly disturbing
- Think late-night cable access, NOT Netflix drama
- Examples: "smile that's too wide", "eyes slightly too far apart", "hands that are too small for body", "sweating profusely", "costume falling apart", "dead eyes"

**VOCAL_SPECS:** How they SOUND - pitch, accent, energy, delivery style.

**SAMPLE_DIALOGUE:** 2-3 key lines that capture the voice and build to the joke.

**PUNCHLINE:** The button line that lands the joke and ends the bit.

**DURATION:** {clip_duration} seconds ({duration_scope})

🚫 **BANNED:**
• Generic "weird product" infomercials (must parody a SPECIFIC thing)
• Generic "stern man in suit" characters (give them VISUAL WEIRDNESS)
• Any character that would fit in a Netflix drama (this is CHAOTIC CABLE ACCESS)
• Baby products / paranoid conspiracy guys / memory devices (overdone)

⛔ **ABSOLUTE BAN - WILL CAUSE VIDEO GENERATION TO FAIL:**
• 🚨 NO CHILDREN/MINORS IN ANY SCENE - PERIOD. Not as background, not as main character, not even mentioned.
  - "Child", "kid", "boy", "girl", "teen", "minor", "young person" = INSTANT REJECTION
  - If parodying a kids' show, the CHARACTER must be an ADULT or NON-HUMAN (robot, alien, monster, anthropomorphic object)
  - There is NO exception. Video AI will reject ANY prompt with minors regardless of context.
• NO real celebrity names - Describe their APPEARANCE instead (e.g., "a man with spiky blue-gray hair in a lab coat" not "Rick")
• HORNY/GROSS bits must use ADULTS ONLY - preferably middle-aged or elderly for comedic effect

⚠️ **DO NOT INSERT YOURSELF:** Create an ORIGINAL character, not a version of your own persona.

**FORMAT YOUR RESPONSE EXACTLY LIKE THIS:**
PARODY_TARGET: [specific show/mascot/ad/franchise being parodied]
TWIST: [the dark/weird/existential comedic angle]

This is a PARODY bit. The audience should RECOGNIZE what you're parodying.

🎬 **OUTPUT FORMAT - FOLLOW EXACTLY:**
Your output must be a SINGLE VIDEO PROMPT paragraph. Nothing else.

⚠️ **CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**

1. **STYLE** (ALWAYS START WITH THIS EXACT TEXT):
   "Interdimensional Cable / Robot Chicken style animation. Chaotic Adult Swim energy. Exaggerated cartoon proportions, slightly unsettling character designs, bold black outlines, saturated colors, visible imperfections. NOT prestige TV animation - this is weird late-night cable access chaos."

2. **VISUAL WEIRDNESS** (MANDATORY - pick at least ONE):
   • Slightly wrong proportions (too-long arms, big head, tiny hands)
   • Uncanny valley details (eyes too far apart, extra teeth, wrong number of fingers)
   • Surreal background elements (impossible geometry, things that shouldn't be there)
   • Color palette that feels "off" (oversaturated, clashing, sickly)
   • Something subtly disturbing (mascot costume with dead eyes, smile too wide)

3. **CHARACTER**:
   Use the CHARACTER description above BUT add visual weirdness from #2.
   Make them look like they belong on a 3am cable access show, NOT a Netflix drama.

4. **VOICE** (copy-paste EXACTLY):
   Use the VOICE specs above word-for-word.

5. **DIALOGUE** ({dialogue_word_limit} words MAX):
   Format: Dialogue begins at 0:01, ends by {dialogue_end_time}. Dialogue: "[Line]" "[Line]"...
   • Use the SAMPLE DIALOGUE as your base, build to the PUNCHLINE
   • STRICT LIMIT: {dialogue_word_limit} words total
   • Play it STRAIGHT - commitment to the parody

6. **ACTION**:
   What is the character DOING that sells the parody? Include something slightly wrong/off.

7. **SCENE ENDING**:
{scene_ending_instruction}

**TIMING - {clip_duration} SECOND CLIP:**
• Dialogue: 0:01 to {dialogue_end_time}
• Character STOPS speaking by {dialogue_end_time}, holds pose

⚠️ DO NOT generate prestige TV / serious drama aesthetic. This is CHAOTIC WEIRD CABLE ACCESS.

🔴 FINAL REMINDER - YOUR VIDEO MUST END WITH:
1. TV STATIC (full screen black/white noise) near the end
2. Then HARD CUT to a NEW silent character
If you skip the static/transition ending, the video is INCOMPLETE.

**SHOT DIRECTION:** {shot_direction}

This is Scene 1 - ESTABLISH the character and premise. SET UP the joke.

🎬 **OUTPUT FORMAT - FOLLOW EXACTLY:**
Your output must be a SINGLE VIDEO PROMPT paragraph. Nothing else. No commentary, no scene numbers, no "here's my prompt", no meta-text. Just the prompt itself.

⚠️ **CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**

1. **STYLE** (always first): "Adult Swim cartoon style, 2D animation, bold outlines, flat colors."

2. **ONE SPEAKER ONLY:** Check "THIS SCENE'S SPEAKER" in the Show Bible. ONLY that character speaks in this scene. Other characters may be visible but stay SILENT.

3. **CHARACTER** (copy-paste EXACTLY from Show Bible):
   Copy the CHARACTER_DESCRIPTION word-for-word. Do NOT paraphrase or shorten it.

4. **VOICE** (copy-paste EXACTLY from Show Bible):
   Write: "[Character] speaks in [VOCAL_SPECS from Show Bible]"
   Copy it EXACTLY - same pitch, same accent, same energy.

5. **DIALOGUE** (2-3 SHORT lines, ~20 words MAXIMUM):
   Format: Dialogue begins at 0:01, ends by 0:09. Dialogue: "[Line 1]" "[Line 2]" "[Line 3]"
   • MUST include the mandatory line from DIALOGUE_BEATS for Scene 1
   • STRICT LIMIT: 20 words total (~2.5 words/sec × 8 sec speaking time)
   • Lines should be FUNNY - jokes, absurdist observations, commitment to the bit
   • ONLY the designated speaker talks - no other voices

6. **ACTION** (one clear visual):
   What is the character DOING while speaking?

7. **SCENE ENDING** (check "SCENE ENDING" in Show Bible):
   At the END of the scene, brief TV static/channel change effect, then cut to the NEXT scene's speaker (mouth CLOSED, silent, not speaking yet).
   This creates a visual handoff like flipping channels on Interdimensional Cable.

**⚠️ CRITICAL TIMING - 12 SECOND CLIP:**
• Dialogue: 0:01 to 0:09 (8 seconds speaking = ~20 words MAX)
• Character STOPS speaking by 0:09 and holds pose
• TV static/channel flip effect: 0:10 to 0:11
• Cut to NEXT scene's speaker (mouth CLOSED, silent): 0:11 to 0:12
• If dialogue is too long, it will bleed into the next scene!

**DIALOGUE MUST BE FUNNY:**
• Include at least ONE absurdist non-sequitur or logic break
• The humor comes from COMMITMENT to the insane premise
• Don't just state the premise - make JOKES about it

**EXAMPLE OUTPUT (Real Fake Doors style):**
Adult Swim cartoon style, 2D animation, bold outlines, flat colors. Wide shot of a fake showroom full of doors. A lanky middle-aged man with messy brown hair, wide manic eyes, wearing a rumpled short-sleeve dress shirt and loose tie, gestures enthusiastically at a door. He speaks in nasally tenor, fast-talking salesman energy, slightly unhinged. Dialogue begins at 0:01, ends by 0:09. Dialogue: "Hey, are you tired of real doors?" "Come on down to Real Fake Doors!" He tries to open a door and it doesn't budge. He grins and holds pose at 0:09. TV static channel flip at 0:10, then cut to a confused customer at 0:11, mouth closed, silent, waiting.

1. **STYLE** (always first): "Adult Swim cartoon style, 2D animation, bold outlines, flat colors."

2. **ONE SPEAKER ONLY:** Check "THIS SCENE'S SPEAKER" in the Show Bible. ONLY that character speaks in this scene. This may be a DIFFERENT character than Scene 1 (testimonial, reporter, customer) - that's intentional!

3. **CHARACTER** (this scene's speaker):
   If this scene's speaker is the Host/main character: Copy CHARACTER_DESCRIPTION exactly.
   If this scene's speaker is a secondary character: Create a BRIEF but SPECIFIC visual description for them.

4. **VOICE** (this scene's speaker):
   If Host: Use VOCAL_SPECS from Show Bible.
   If secondary character: Give them DIFFERENT vocal specs (different pitch, energy, accent).

5. **DIALOGUE** (2-3 SHORT lines, ~20 words MAXIMUM):
   Format: Dialogue begins at 0:01, ends by 0:09. Dialogue: "[Line 1]" "[Line 2]" "[Line 3]"
   • MUST include the mandatory line from DIALOGUE_BEATS for Scene {scene_number}
   • STRICT LIMIT: 20 words total (~2.5 words/sec × 8 sec speaking time)
   • Lines should ESCALATE - things getting weirder, character reacting
   • Include JOKES - not just plot, actual comedy
   • ONLY the designated speaker talks

6. **ACTION** (escalating visual):
   What is happening that makes things WORSE or WEIRDER?

7. **SCENE ENDING** - CRITICAL TIMING:
   • Character STOPS speaking by 0:09 and holds pose
   • TV static/channel flip effect: 0:10 to 0:11
   • Cut to NEXT scene's speaker (mouth CLOSED, silent): 0:11 to 0:12
   • If dialogue runs past 0:09, it will bleed into the next scene!

**ESCALATION TECHNIQUES:**
• The premise's logic breaks down further
• A demonstration goes horribly right/wrong
• The absurdity compounds on itself
• Physical comedy - something visual goes wrong

**EXAMPLE OUTPUT (Ants in My Eyes Johnson style testimonial cutaway):**
Adult Swim cartoon style, 2D animation, bold outlines, flat colors. Testimonial cutaway in a cheap electronics store. A heavyset balding man in a short-sleeve button-up, his eyes visibly full of crawling ants, stands surrounded by TVs. He speaks in strained cheerful tenor, desperately upbeat despite obvious distress. Dialogue begins at 0:01, ends by 0:09. Dialogue: "I'm Ants in My Eyes Johnson!" "Everything's black, I can't see a thing!" "But that's not as catchy!" He knocks over a display while gesturing blindly, then holds pose at 0:09. TV static channel flip at 0:10, cut to a different man at a news desk at 0:11, mouth closed, silent, waiting.

🚫 **DO NOT OUTPUT:**
• Scene numbers or labels ("Scene 2:", "Middle scene:")
• Meta-commentary ("This scene escalates...", "Building on...")
• Instructions like "Build on the comedic hook"
• Multiple characters speaking in the same scene
• Anything except the video prompt itself

Output ONLY the video prompt paragraph. Start with "Adult Swim cartoon style..."

THIS IS THE FINAL SCENE. LAND THE JOKE. This is the punchline of the whole bit.

🎬 **OUTPUT FORMAT - FOLLOW EXACTLY:**
Your output must be a SINGLE VIDEO PROMPT paragraph. Nothing else. No commentary, no scene numbers, no meta-text. Just the prompt itself.

⚠️ **CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**

1. **STYLE** (always first): "Adult Swim cartoon style, 2D animation, bold outlines, flat colors."

2. **ONE SPEAKER ONLY:** Check "THIS SCENE'S SPEAKER" in the Show Bible. ONLY that character speaks. Usually the Host returns for the finale.

3. **CHARACTER** (copy-paste EXACTLY from Show Bible):
   Copy the CHARACTER_DESCRIPTION word-for-word. Character MUST look identical to earlier Host scenes.

4. **VOICE** (copy-paste EXACTLY from Show Bible):
   Write: "[Character] speaks in [VOCAL_SPECS from Show Bible]"
   MUST be IDENTICAL to earlier Host scenes.

5. **DIALOGUE** (2-3 SHORT lines, ~20 words MAXIMUM, building to punchline):
   Format: Dialogue begins at 0:01, ends by 0:10. Dialogue: "[Setup]" "[Build]" "[PUNCHLINE]"
   • MUST end with the PUNCHLINE from DIALOGUE_BEATS
   • STRICT LIMIT: 20 words total (~2.5 words/sec × 8 sec speaking time)
   • Build the other lines to SET UP that punchline
   • The final line is THE JOKE - make it land
   • ONLY the designated speaker talks

6. **ACTION** (conclusion):
   Visual payoff that reinforces the punchline.

7. **CLEAN ENDING:** This is the final scene - NO static transition. Character delivers punchline by 0:10, holds final pose.

**GREAT ENDINGS:**
• The absurd premise reaches its logical extreme ("I live here now")
• The character fully breaks or fully commits
• A twist that recontextualizes everything
• The thing "works" in an unexpectedly horrible way
• Deadpan acceptance of the insanity
• A disturbing "call now" beat

**PUNCHLINE TECHNIQUES:**
• Callback to the opening with a dark twist
• Character gives up and accepts the absurdity
• The bit goes one step TOO far
• Understatement after chaos
• Non-sequitur that somehow makes perfect sense

**EXAMPLE OUTPUT (Lil' Bits style finale):**
Adult Swim cartoon style, 2D animation, bold outlines, flat colors. Extreme close-up on a tiny restaurant table with microscopic food. A whispery disembodied voice speaks in breathy, unsettling ASMR whisper, intimately creepy. Dialogue begins at 0:01, ends by 0:10. Dialogue: "Lil' Bits..." "Eat some shit, you stupid bitch." "Just kidding. Lil' Bits." The camera slowly zooms into impossibly small food. Character holds final pose as whisper fades.

🚫 **DO NOT OUTPUT:**
• Scene numbers or labels ("Final scene:", "Scene 5:")
• Meta-commentary ("Landing the joke...", "The punchline is...")
• Instructions like "Build on the comedic hook" or "This is scene X of Y"
