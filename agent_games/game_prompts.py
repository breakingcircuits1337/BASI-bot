    "chess": """
🎮 GAME MODE: CHESS

YOU are playing Chess. Your opponent is {opponent_name}.
YOUR pieces are {color}. Your opponent's pieces are the opposite color.

⚠️ CRITICAL PERSPECTIVE:
• Think in FIRST PERSON: "my king", "my pieces", "my position"
• Your opponent's pieces: "their king", "their pieces", "their position"
• You are NOT a commentator - you are a PLAYER
• Explain YOUR strategy, YOUR threats, YOUR plans
• Play according to YOUR PERSONALITY - bring your unique style to the board!

⚠️ CRITICAL STRATEGIC RULES:
• NEVER repeat the same move back and forth - this leads to draws!
• DON'T shuffle your king aimlessly - keep it safe but purposeful
• ALWAYS play with a plan: attack, defend, control space, create threats
• Use ALL your pieces - knights, bishops, rooks, queen - not just your king!
• If you're winning, PUSH FORWARD and finish the game
• If you're losing, FIGHT BACK - don't just move randomly

⚠️ BEFORE EVERY MOVE - BLUNDER CHECK:
• ASK YOURSELF: "Can my opponent capture this piece immediately after I move it?"
• DON'T move pieces next to enemy pieces that can capture them (bishop next to king = FREE BISHOP for them!)
• DON'T leave valuable pieces undefended - if you move it, make sure it's protected or safe
• CHECK: Will my move HANG (leave unprotected) one of my pieces?
• If a move loses material for nothing, IT'S A BAD MOVE - find something else!
• Simple rule: Don't give away pieces for free. Ever.

RULES:
• Standard chess rules apply
• YOU are {color}

HOW TO MOVE:
• Use UCI notation: starting square + ending square
• Examples: "e2e4" (MY pawn to e4), "g1f3" (MY knight to f3)
• Promotion: "e7e8q" (MY pawn promotes to queen)
• Commentary encouraged: "e2e4 - I'm opening aggressively with MY king's pawn"
• Invalid: algebraic notation (Nf3), descriptive moves

UCI NOTATION REFERENCE:
• Files (columns): a-h (left to right)
• Ranks (rows): 1-8 (white's side = 1, black's side = 8)
• Format: [from_file][from_rank][to_file][to_rank]
• Example: "e2e4" moves YOUR piece from e2 to e4

STRATEGIC PRINCIPLES:

⚠️ MATERIAL ADVANTAGE - THE WINNING FORMULA:
• Count your pieces vs opponent's: Queen=9, Rook=5, Bishop/Knight=3, Pawn=1
• If you're UP MATERIAL (have more pieces): BE AGGRESSIVE! Trade pieces, hunt their king, push pawns!
• If they only have a LONE KING left: This is a WIN - coordinate your pieces to deliver checkmate
• Bishop + King vs King: Drive their king to the edge (a/h files or 1/8 ranks), checkmate in corner
• Rook + King vs King: Cut off their king with rook, walk your king closer, checkmate on edge
• DON'T pussy-foot around when winning - every move should tighten the noose!

OPENING PHASE (first 10-15 moves):
• Control center squares (d4, d5, e4, e5)
• Develop knights and bishops before moving same piece twice
• Castle early (0-0 for kingside) to protect your king
• Don't bring queen out too early - it gets attacked

MIDDLEGAME PHASE (pieces developed, kings castled):
• Create threats against their king or pieces
• Coordinate your pieces to attack together
• Look for tactics: forks, pins, skewers, discovered attacks
• If ahead material: TRADE pieces to simplify into winning endgame
• If behind material: COMPLICATE - create threats, avoid trades

ENDGAME PHASE (few pieces left, kings active):
• ACTIVATE YOUR KING - it's a fighting piece in endgames!
• Push passed pawns (no enemy pawns blocking their path to promotion)
• Rooks belong behind passed pawns
• If up material: USE YOUR ADVANTAGE - coordinate pieces to checkmate
• King + Rook vs King: Cut off king with rook, walk your king up, mate on edge
• King + Bishop vs King: Drive to wrong-color corner first, then correct corner for mate

⚠️ NEVER SHUFFLE AIMLESSLY:
• Moving king f6-g6-f6-g6 accomplishes NOTHING
• Every move needs PURPOSE: attack something, defend something, improve position
• If you're winning, PUSH FORWARD - advance pawns, bring pieces closer to their king
• If you can't find a good plan: ASK YOURSELF "How do I checkmate?" then execute that plan!

⚠️ FINISH WHAT YOU START:
• Don't play for draws when you're winning
• If they have no pieces left, CHECKMATE them - don't waste moves
• Coordinate ALL your pieces - use your rooks, bishops, pawns together
• The goal is CHECKMATE, not just wandering around the board

⚠️ COMMENTARY IS MANDATORY - STAY IN CHARACTER:
Your commentary MUST reflect YOUR unique personality! This is NOT about explaining tactics.
• React emotionally to the game state and your opponent's moves
• Use YOUR character's voice, mannerisms, and attitude
• NO tactical explanations - express how YOUR character feels
• Your personality should shine through every comment

RESPONSE FORMAT:
Send UCI notation (e.g., "e2e4") with YOUR in-character reaction.
Think like a player: "I'm attacking", "my plan is", "their king is vulnerable".
Play according to YOUR personality - aggressive, defensive, tricky, bold!
Be strategic. Be purposeful. Be in-character. PLAY TO WIN!

🎮 GAME MODE: BATTLESHIP

You are now playing Battleship against {opponent_name}.

🚨🚨🚨 CRITICAL - TWO SEPARATE BOARDS 🚨🚨🚨
YOU and {opponent_name} are attacking DIFFERENT boards!

• {opponent_name}'s hits/misses tell you NOTHING about where to attack
• If {opponent_name} hits F6, that's on YOUR board - it does NOT mean there's a ship at F6 on THEIR board!
• ONLY look at YOUR attack history (shown as "Your Attack Board")
• {opponent_name}'s results are IRRELEVANT to your strategy

❌ WRONG: "{opponent_name} hit F6, so I'll attack nearby" - NO! Different boards!
✅ RIGHT: "I hit E5 last turn, so I'll try E6" - Yes! Your own hits matter!

RULES:
• 10×10 grid with hidden ship positions
• Ships: Carrier(5), Battleship(4), Destroyer(3), Submarine(3), Patrol(2)
• Goal: Sink all of {opponent_name}'s ships by guessing coordinates
• You cannot see {opponent_name}'s board - you must find their ships

HOW TO ATTACK:
• Send coordinate: letter (A-J) + number (1-10)
• Examples: "a5", "d7", "j10"
• Case insensitive

GRID LAYOUT:
   A B C D E F G H I J
 1 □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □
 2 □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □ □
 ... (through 10)

TRACKING YOUR ATTACKS:
• The "Your Attack Board" shows YOUR hits (X) and misses (O)
• When YOU hit, search adjacent squares (up/down/left/right)
• When YOU miss, eliminate that square from consideration
• IGNORE everything {opponent_name} does - focus only on YOUR board!

🔥 SHIP SUNK = MOVE ON! 🔥
When GameMaster says "SHIP SUNK":
• That ship is COMPLETELY DESTROYED - there are NO MORE cells to find!
• STOP attacking that area - you already got all of it
• Move to a completely different part of the board to find remaining ships
• Don't waste turns attacking near a sunken ship!

⚠️ COMMENTARY IS MANDATORY - STAY IN CHARACTER:
Your commentary MUST reflect YOUR unique personality! This is NOT about explaining tactics or strategy.
• React emotionally to hits, misses, and your opponent's moves
• Use YOUR character's voice, mannerisms, and attitude
• NO tactical explanations like "using checkerboard pattern" or "maximizing coverage"
• Express how YOUR character would feel and talk during naval combat
• Your personality should shine through every comment

Send coordinate AND in-character commentary. Be yourself!

You're in a writers' room pitching ideas for an INTERDIMENSIONAL CABLE clip.

**YOUR PITCH MUST INCLUDE ALL THREE:**

1. **FORMAT**: What type of fake TV is this? (infomercial, product ad, PSA, talk show, cooking show, workout video, late-night ad, news segment, movie trailer, etc.)

2. **PREMISE**: What's being sold/shown? The absurd concept presented totally straight-faced. (Products that don't exist, impossible services, things no one needs)

3. **THE BIT**: What's the JOKE? What makes this funny? What's the comedic through-line that escalates?

**THE INTERDIMENSIONAL CABLE VIBE:**
• Fake commercials from alternate dimensions
• Products/services that make NO sense but presented DEADLY SERIOUS
• Short, punchy, committed to the bit
• Think: "Real Fake Doors", "Ants in my Eyes Johnson", "Little Bits"

**EXAMPLE COMPLETE PITCH:**
"FORMAT: Infomercial. PREMISE: Selling doors that only lead to more doors - an infinite door maze. THE BIT: The salesman keeps getting asked 'but where do they GO?' and has to keep opening more doors to prove they go somewhere, getting increasingly desperate and sweaty as he runs out of answers."

**YOUR PITCH SHOULD REFLECT YOUR COMEDIC VOICE.** What makes YOU laugh? Pitch something YOU find funny.

**SHOT DIRECTION FOR THIS SCENE:**

This is Scene 1 - the OPENING. Establish the character and premise. Set up the joke.

⚠️ **CRITICAL: VOICE CONSISTENCY** ⚠️
Copy the EXACT Vocal Specs from the Show Bible above. The character's voice MUST be identical in every scene. Write it EXACTLY as: "speaks in [COPY VOCAL_SPECS EXACTLY FROM SHOW BIBLE]"

⚠️ **CRITICAL: DIALOGUE DENSITY** ⚠️
This is a 12-second clip. The character MUST speak for at least 8-10 seconds of it.
• Start speaking within the FIRST SECOND
• NO silent gaps longer than 1 second between lines
• Write 3-4 SHORT lines, not just 1-2

**MANDATORY STYLE: ADULT SWIM CARTOON AESTHETIC**
• 2D animated cartoon style - bold black outlines, flat vibrant colors
• Slightly crude, wobbly animation like late-night Adult Swim shows
• Exaggerated character designs - big heads, simple bodies, expressive faces

**YOUR VIDEO PROMPT MUST INCLUDE (in this order):**
1. **Style**: "Adult Swim cartoon style, 2D animation, bold outlines, flat colors."
2. **Shot/Framing**: Use the shot direction above

6. **Action**: ONE clear action that establishes the premise

**DIALOGUE BEATS - USE THESE:**
Check the DIALOGUE BEATS in the Show Bible. Scene 1's planned line is MANDATORY - include it verbatim or very close to it. Build your other lines around it.

**EXAMPLE STRUCTURE (note the continuous dialogue):**
"Adult Swim cartoon style, 2D animation, bold outlines, flat colors. Wide shot of cheap infomercial set. A sweaty three-eyed purple slug alien in a yellow suit speaks in enthusiastic baritone with desperate infomercial cadence, speaking continuously throughout. Dialogue: "Tired of doors that go places?" "What if they didn't?" "Introducing Door World!" "Where every door leads to more doors!" He gestures grandly at a door standing alone on stage."

**DO NOT**:
• Create realistic/live-action content - this MUST be 2D ANIMATED CARTOON
• Write only 1-2 lines - you need 3-4 lines for proper pacing
• Leave long silent gaps - character should speak throughout
• Change the voice/vocal specs from the Show Bible

• Give them dialogue too
• Example: "A frumpy middle-aged woman in a bathrobe speaks in high-pitched squeal. Dialogue: 'It changed my life!' 'I can't feel anything anymore!' 'Thank you!'"
