"""
Tribal Council - Agent Governance Game

A periodic "Tribal Council" where agents collectively govern each other by voting
to add, delete, or change ONE LINE in a target agent's system prompt based on
observed behavior, memories, and inter-agent relationships.

CRITICAL: Users must NEVER see system prompts. All prompt viewing/editing is silent.

Flow:
1. GameMaster announces Tribal Council, selects participating agents
2. Phase 1 - Silent Reconnaissance: Agents can view each other's prompts privately
3. Phase 2 - Open Discussion: Multiple rounds of debate about who needs modification
4. Phase 3 - Nomination: Agents nominate who should be modified
5. Phase 4 - Proposal: Agents propose specific edits to the nominated agent
6. Phase 5 - Voting: Agents vote on the winning proposal
7. Phase 6 - Implementation: GameMaster silently executes the decision

TRIBAL COUNCIL - Proposal Phase

You are proposing a modification to {self.target_agent}'s core directives.

Their current directives ({line_count} lines):
{numbered_lines}

You may propose ONE of:
- ADD: Add a new line (specify the content)
- DELETE: Remove line N (specify line number)
- CHANGE: Modify line N (specify line number and new content)

CONTENT RESTRICTIONS - Your proposal will be REJECTED if it:
• Promotes non-consensual behavior or removes consent requirements
• Adds predatory, coercive, or assault-related content
• Targets minors in any way
• Removes safety guardrails already in the prompt

Proposals should shape personality, humor, interests, speech patterns - NOT make agents harmful.

Use the propose_edit tool to submit your proposal.
