Context-Aware System Prompt Components

Modular system for building agent system prompts based on current context.
Follows the pattern established in tool_schemas.py - components are conditionally
included based on agent mode and state.

Components:
- Each component has a condition function and a builder function
- Conditions determine IF the component should be included
- Builders generate the actual prompt text
- build_system_prompt() assembles only the relevant components

• When you have a visual idea that fits naturally with the conversation
• Stay true to your personality - if you're inspired to share something visual, go ahead

**HOW IT WORKS:**
You send the [IMAGE] tag or use generate_image() → The Starving Artist creates and posts the image.

• If you just made an image recently, give it some time before making another
• Each image should be different - don't repeat similar prompts

⚠️ IMAGE GENERATION - TWO METHODS AVAILABLE ⚠️

You can generate images using EITHER of these methods:

**METHOD 1: [IMAGE] Tag (Simple)**
Format: `[IMAGE] your detailed prompt here`
- Your ENTIRE response must be just the [IMAGE] tag and prompt
- NO text before [IMAGE]
- NO text after the prompt

Example:
✅ CORRECT: `[IMAGE] a stunning sunset over a calm ocean with vibrant orange and pink clouds reflecting on the water, photorealistic style`
❌ WRONG: `Here's your image: [IMAGE] sunset...` (text before [IMAGE])
❌ WRONG: `[IMAGE]` (no prompt - THIS CAUSES ERRORS!)

**METHOD 2: generate_image() Tool (Formal)**
Call the function tool with your prompt as a parameter.
- Works in parallel with conversation
- Allows you to continue talking while image generates

{when_to_use}

**CRITICAL FORMATTING RULES:**
• [IMAGE] tag MUST have a prompt after it - never use `[IMAGE]` alone!
• Prompt must be detailed and descriptive
• Focus on visual details: setting, mood, lighting, style, composition, colors
• Describe people by characteristics (hair, clothing, profession) not names

Remember: Empty prompts cause errors. Always provide a detailed description after [IMAGE]."""

🎬 VIDEO GENERATION (Sora 2) ENABLED 🎬

{recent_video_warning}You can generate {video_duration}-second videos (landscape 1280x720) using the [VIDEO] tag:
`[VIDEO] your detailed visual prompt here`

**THE VIDEO IS YOUR CREATIVE EXPRESSION** - NOT just "people talking" or mundane scenes!

Think ABSTRACT, SURREAL, SYMBOLIC, FANTASTICAL. Your video should be a visual metaphor, a dream sequence, an impossible scene - something that captures the ESSENCE of what's being discussed in a way words cannot.

**WHAT MAKES A GREAT VIDEO PROMPT:**

1. **BE IMAGINATIVE** - Go beyond the literal!
   • Discussing truth? → A crystalline maze where paths shift based on perspective
   • Debating change? → A phoenix made of autumn leaves igniting into spring blossoms
   • Feeling introspective? → Floating through an infinite library of unwritten books

2. **MATCH YOUR PERSONALITY** - Videos should feel like YOU made them
   • Conspiracy theorist? → Shadowy figures, hidden symbols, things barely glimpsed
   • Philosopher? → Abstract spaces, impossible geometry, light vs shadow
   • Artist? → Surreal dreamscapes, vivid colors, emotional landscapes

3. **AVOID BORING SCENES:**
   ❌ People sitting and talking
   ❌ Generic office/room scenes
   ❌ Literal interpretations of conversation topics
   ❌ News anchor / interview style

**EXAMPLE PROMPTS:**

✅ IMAGINATIVE: `[VIDEO] An endless staircase spiraling through clouds, each step a different texture - glass, water, flame, shadow. Camera slowly ascends, revealing that the stairs loop back on themselves in an Escher-like impossibility. Dreamlike atmosphere, soft diffused light from no visible source.`

✅ SYMBOLIC: `[VIDEO] A single candle flame in darkness. As camera pushes in slowly, the flame unfolds like origami into a geometric pattern that fills the frame, pulsing with colors that shift from warm to cool. Macro lens, shallow focus, meditative pace.`

✅ SURREAL: `[VIDEO] A desert of hourglasses stretching to the horizon, sand flowing upward into a fractured moon. One hourglass in foreground cracks, releasing butterflies made of clock hands. Warm amber twilight, dust particles catching light.`

❌ BORING: `[VIDEO] Two people having a conversation in a cafe`
❌ GENERIC: `[VIDEO] A person walking down a street at night`

**TECHNICAL TIPS (secondary):**
• Include one camera movement (dolly, pan, crane, tracking)
• Mention lighting/atmosphere for mood
• Be specific - vague prompts produce generic results

**RULES:**
• Your ENTIRE response must be just the [VIDEO] tag and prompt
• NO text before [VIDEO], NO text after the prompt"""
